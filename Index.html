            BIO
            <h2 class="w3-center">Thinkful Beginner</h2>
            <p class="w3-large">I am a student web developer. I continue to learn,daily,
                on how to be productive in this type of field. I have accomplished and completed many projects such as
                a quiz app, bookmark app, and creating my first web page.
                My education and experiences are completely different than those of
                a software developer. I have an Associates Degree from Univesity of Pheonix in Criminal
                Justice and I worked 15 years in law enforcement.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-large"> My health and lifestyle has placed me in a position to change my career and my path
                for success <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">(besides two glasses of mimosa</span>and a tylenol).
                My investments in laptops , desktops ,tablets, and ipads causes me to have an obsession in exploring
                the
                fundementals of web development. I am always finding creative ways to designs web pages.
            </p>
            <p class="w3-large">Now,creating and having hands-on experience , has been fascinating.
                I want to establish my own contract business ,remotely with a team of programmers, helping others to
                create their own web
                designs
                or business apps. I would
                like to see myself in the future creating and publishing the work I have done for other people and
                businesses.</p>

            Project 1
            <p class="w3-large w3-text-blue-grey w3-text-medium "> I created a quiz app with one of my classmates. We
                came up with something that we both enjoy watching
                , I believe I was more of a fan, we came up with a fan quiz app. We started this quiz app
                with the flex-box method,using javascript, html, css, and json.

            Project 2
            <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-text-medium">My Bookmark app has been one of my most
                challenging projects. I started my bookmark app with a box mobile design and in use
                javascript, api, jquery, html5, css3, and json. I am continuing to work on this project
                for outstanding results.
